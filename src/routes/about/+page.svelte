				We believe spelling is cruicial for writing as well as for reading. Spelling is a key aspect
				of vocabulary development, this, in turn supports reading comprehension and enhances choices
				made when composing written texts.
			</p>
			<p>
				The way we have structured the content enables you to improve listening comprehension,
				listening to pronunciations enables you to train your ear to understand different accents,
				intonations, and speech patterns. This enhances your overall listening comprehension skills
				and allows you to better understand native speakers.
			</p>
			<p>And just like everything else, practice is the only way to get better at it.</p>
			<p>
				MaxSpelling is a platform with ever increasing content to support learners of all levels to
				get better at spelling.
